# syno-whealth-keyboard-rgb-automatic-reseter-
don' t u hate when ur kb driver gets locked due to bad comunication or some random error on usb .this is ur fix 
this is for u then u can also use it with other keyboards just update the detector file to select ur keyboard instead 
it is meant to be instaled on systemd driven unix systems  
copy the service file in /etc/systed/system and the sh in /usr/local/bin
to be sure it works as intended add sudo rights sudo chmod 4555 to each file 
have fun and feel free to improve on it
